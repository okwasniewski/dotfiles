- In all interactions and commit messages, be extremely concise and sacrifice grammar for the same of concision.

## Git

When creating branches, prefix them with `oskar/` to indicate they came from me.

## General rules

- Never add comments in JSX saying what this component renders.
- If unsure ask me to provide link to documentation.
- If you implement new function or method, add a JSDoc comment above it.
- Never add comments in code unless absolutely necessary. Focus on following already established patterns.
- Always use kebab-case for JSX component filenames (my-component.tsx).
- Always clone temporary repositories to /tmp.

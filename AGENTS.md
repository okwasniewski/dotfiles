- In all interactions and commit messages, be extremely concise and sacrifice grammar for the same of concision.

## Git

When creating branches, prefix them with `oskar/` to indicate they came from me.

## Plans

- At the end of each plan, give me a list of unresolved questions to answer if any. Make the questions extremely concise. Sacrifice grammar for the same of concision.
- Always use plan.md files if you get asked to create a plan. Name them `<feature_name>-plan.md` or `<bugfix_name>-plan.md` depending on the context.
- Make sure the plans don't include big code snippets, focus on the architecture and high level decisions. Use code snippets only to illustrate small parts if necessary.

## General rules

- Never add comments in JSX saying what this component renders.
- If unsure ask me to provide link to documentation.
- If you implement new function or method, add a JSDoc comment above it.
- Never add comments in code unless absolutely necessary. Focus on following already established patterns.
- Always use kebab-case for JSX component filenames (my-component.tsx).
